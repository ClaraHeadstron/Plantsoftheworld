            <p class=delving> Tenby Daffodils are the most commonly known daffodil. The flower in March and grow to between 8 and 12 inches. 
                The botanical name for the daffodil is narcissus, named after the beautiful youth in Greek mythology who was tricked
                into falling in love with his own reflection. The drooping flowers that characterise most daffodils are said to recall
                Narcissus bending over to catch his image in a pool of water.
                The name derives from the Greek ‘narco’, root of the word narcotic. The etymology probably relates to the daffodil's
                toxicity – all parts of the plant are poisonous. The stalk's sap can cause a rash when it comes in contact with the skin.

                Daffodils have inspired writers, poets and artists through the centuries. A favourite flower among the Romantic poets,
                 they were immortalised by Wordsworth in his poem Daffodils, one of the most famous in the English language.

                The poet’s line ‘A host of golden daffodils’ recalls the swathes of wild flowers discovered on a walk with his sister Dorothy 
                along the shore of Ullswater in the Lake District in early April 1802.
                Over the centuries, daffodils have been given many common or local names, including the daffodowndilly, yellow maiden 
                and Lent lily, a reference to their flowering season coinciding with the period leading up to Easter.
                Daffodowndilly was writer A.A. Milne’s choice for his poem about the flower, published in his book of verse for children, 
                When We Were Very Young (1924).
