		<p>The natural landscape has been least affected by people in sparsely populated North Asia. 
			Vast plains, continentality, and the nearness of the Arctic Ocean explain the presence there of 
			a zone of tundra—cold-tolerant low-lying vegetation in an area of permafrost (permanently frozen 
			subsoil)—similar to that found in the European part of Russia and in Canada and the U.S. state of 
			Alaska. In more flourishing parts, the tundra has a discontinuous covering of lichens, mosses, sedges, 
			rushes, some grasses, cushions of bilberries, and dwarf trees of willow and birch; in the far north, 
			lichens grow on favourable hillsides. Because of the greater number of hours of daylight during the 
			summer months, when the Arctic Circle region receives the same amount of light energy as the tropics, 
			the tundra in that season is covered with bright flowers. Nevertheless, climate conditions are extreme. 
			The soil never thaws below a depth of 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm)
